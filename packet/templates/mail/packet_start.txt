Hello {{ packet.freshman.name }},

Welcome to Computer Science House!

Soon you'll starting the introductory process for CSH, and the first part of that is Packet.

Your packet will start on {{ packet.start.strftime('%A, %B %-d') }} at {{ packet.start.strftime('%-I:%M %p') }}

You can view your packet at {{ config["PROTOCOL"] + config["PACKET_INTRO"] }} with the credentials you should have been sent.
If you don't know your credentials, reach out to an RTP

If you have any questions about Packet or the introductory process, email evals@csh.rit.edu

If you have any questions about login credentials or any technical issues, email rtp@csh.rit.edu
